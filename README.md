# Number-Subtracting-Game
This is a number-based AI game. In this game, there might be two players. One of them will be a computer and another one will be a human. The game will start with two natural numbers. The first player(computer) will subtract any positive multiple of the lesser of the two numbers. If the subtraction result is zero then the player will win. Else we will store the subtraction as a second number. The second player(human) will subtract any positive multiple of the lesser of the two numbers. If the subtraction result is zero then the player will win. Else they will play alternately again and again. But the subtraction can't be less than zero
